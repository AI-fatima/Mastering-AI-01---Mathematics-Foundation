- **Binomial Distribution**: Probability distribution for binary events (e.g., success/failure).

#### **3.2 Bayes' Theorem**

- **Definition**: A way to find the conditional probability of events.
- **Application**: Used in probabilistic models like Bayesian networks and AI-based decision making.

#### **3.3 Expectation and Variance**

- **Expectation (Mean)**: The average or expected value of a random variable.
- **Variance**: Measure of the spread of a set of data, indicating variability.

#### **3.4 Conditional Probability**

- **Definition**: Probability of an event given the occurrence of another event.
- **Application**: Central to Bayesian inference and decision-making in AI models.

### **4. Optimization**

#### **4.1 Gradient Descent**

- **Definition**: An iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize a function.
- **Application in AI**: Used to minimize the loss function during the training of machine learning models.

#### **4.2 Convexity**

- **Definition**: A function is convex if the line segment between any two points on the function's graph lies above or on the graph.
- **Importance**: Convex functions have global minima, making optimization easier.

#### **4.3 Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**

- **Definition**: A variation of gradient descent where only a small batch of data is used in each iteration.
- **Application**: Allows for faster convergence when working with large datasets.

#### **4.4 Advanced Optimization Techniques**

- **Momentum**: Helps accelerate gradient descent in the direction of the steepest decrease.
- **Adam Optimizer**: Combines the advantages of two other popular optimization methodsâ€”Adaptive Gradient Algorithm (AdaGrad) and Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp).

### **Terminologies Specific to AI**

- **Rank**: The number of linearly independent rows or columns in a matrix.
- **Norm**: A function that assigns a strictly positive length or size to vectors (e.g., L2 norm, L1 norm).
- **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**: A matrix factorization method used for dimensionality reduction.
- **Gradient Descent**: Algorithm to minimize the loss function by adjusting model parameters.
- **Cross-Entropy Loss**: A loss function used in classification tasks in machine learning.
